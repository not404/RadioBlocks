{"name":"RadioBlocks Documentation","tagline":"RadioBlocks by Colorado Micro Devices","body":"### RadioBlock by Colorado Micro Devices\r\nIf you have found your way to this collection, you are probably aware that the \"Upstream\" website source for all things related to \r\nRadioBlock, ColoradoMicroDevices.com, is pretty much a blank slate. I (Laurence Lee), was one of the original \r\n[Kickstarter Project](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/545073874/radioblock-simple-radio-for-arduino-or-any-embedde) backers, and \r\nhave had a handful of these nifty devices sitting on a shelf waiting for the day I had enough time to craft up some code that would put them to good use.\r\n\r\nOf course, with the original website \"gone\", it turned out to be an interesting challenge to scour the Internet for these original resources.\r\n\r\nThrough the KickStarter Comments section, you will find that a fellow backer has published a personal archive of these documents \r\nhere: [randallsrus.com](www.randallsrus.com/Jeff/Electronics/RadioBlocks/)\r\n\r\nFurthermore, after some spelunking around in Google caches, and doing some reverse engineering of URLs, I have found that the ColoradoMicroDevices.com \r\nwebsite does indeed host the documents we're looking for -- it's just that the links have \"moved\" to somewhere unpublished.\r\n\r\n### File Links on Original Site ###\r\n* [DATASHEET](http://www.coloradomicrodevices.com/images/documents/RADIOBLOCKS-DATASHEET.pdf)\r\n* [RadioBlocks Quick Start Guide](http://www.coloradomicrodevices.com/images/documents/RadioBlocks-Quick-Start-Guide.pdf)\r\n* [RadioBlcoks - Bootloading Guide](http://www.coloradomicrodevices.com/images/documents/RadioBlocks-Bootloading-Guide.pdf)\r\n* [RadioBlocks Schematic](http://www.coloradomicrodevices.com/images/documents/RadioBlocks.pdf)\r\n* [SimpleMesh User Guide](http://www.coloradomicrodevices.com/images/documents/SimpleMesh-User-Guide.pdf)\r\n* [SimpleMesh Protocol](http://www.coloradomicrodevices.com/images/documents/SimpleMesh-Serial-Protocol.pdf)\r\n\r\n### GitHub Mirror ###\r\nThe above files are also archived within this repository, in the event the original Website finally fades away. Please use the Zip Download link above to get your copy.\r\n\r\n### Additional Code Repositories ###\r\nI also have an archive of various Code Repositories that were published on Assembla.com, whose snapshots were taken some time in early 2013. They may not be the latest n' greatest snapshots. If you find something is stale, \r\nplease help out by a Pull Request with whatever code is needed to refresh or sync with the Assembla.com upstream. Thanks!\r\n\r\n* [radioblock-arduino](https://github.com/not404/radioblock-arduino)\r\n* [radioblock-c](https://github.com/not404/radioblock-c)\r\n* [radioblock-python](https://github.com/not404/radioblock-python)\r\n* [radioblock-simplemesh-firmware](https://github.com/not404/radioblock-simplemesh-firmware)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nI claim no rights to these materials; they are copyrighted and licensed by their respective owners (Colorado Micro Devices). \r\nThis archive merely serves to assist the RadioBlock Developer Community as a backup mirror for posterity.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
