<p>If you have found your way to this documentation collection, you are probably well aware that the "Upstream" website 
source for all things related to RadioBlock, ColoradoMicroDevices.com, is pretty much a blank slate. I (Laurence Lee), was one of the original <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/545073874/radioblock-simple-radio-for-arduino-or-any-embedde">Kickstarter Project</a> backers, and 
have had a handful of these nifty devices sitting on a shelf waiting for the day I had enough time to craft up some code that would put them to good use.</p>

<p>Of course, with the original website "gone", it turned out to be an interesting challenge to scour the Internet for these original resources.</p>

<p>Through the KickStarter Comments section, you may have noticed that a fellow backer has published a personal archive of these documents 
here: <a href="http://www.randallsrus.com/Jeff/Electronics/RadioBlocks/">randallsrus.com</a>. I recommend checking out that site for anything that may not be 
referenced here, such as the Compilers.</p>

<p>In addition to the above mirrored documentation resources, I have done some spelunking around in Google caches, and managed to reverse-engineer 
some of the URLs on ColoradoMicroDevices.com. It turns out the website does indeed have the documents we've been searching for, just "moved" to 
somewhere otherwise unpublished.</p>

<p>I have also Cloned a collection of RadioBlocks-related Code Repositories that were originally published on Assembla.com. My cloned snapshots were originally taken in early 2013, and have been refreshed as of March 2015.
I don't expect them to remain the "latest n' greatest" versions forever, so if you find something is stale, or you have updates you want to share, please help out via Pull Request with whatever is needed to refresh 
or sync with the upstream repositories. Thanks!</p>
