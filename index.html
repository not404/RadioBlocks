<p>If you have found your way to this collection, you are probably aware that the "Upstream" website source for all things related to 
RadioBlock, ColoradoMicroDevices.com, is pretty much a blank slate. I (Laurence Lee), was one of the original 
<a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/545073874/radioblock-simple-radio-for-arduino-or-any-embedde">Kickstarter Project</a> backers, and 
have had a handful of these nifty devices sitting on a shelf waiting for the day I had enough time to craft up some code that would put them to good use.</p>

<p>Of course, with the original website "gone", it turned out to be an interesting challenge to scour the Internet for these original resources.</p>

<p>Through the KickStarter Comments section, you will find that a fellow backer has published a personal archive of these documents 
here: <a href="http://www.randallsrus.com/Jeff/Electronics/RadioBlocks/">randallsrus.com</a></p>

<p>Furthermore, after some spelunking around in Google caches, and doing some reverse engineering of URLs, I have found that the ColoradoMicroDevices.com 
website does indeed host the documents we're looking for -- it's just that the links have "moved" to somewhere unpublished.</p>

<p>I also have an archive of various Code Repositories that were published on Assembla.com, whose snapshots were taken some time in early 2013. They may not be the latest n' greatest snapshots. If you find something is stale, 
please help out by a Pull Request with whatever code is needed to refresh or sync with the Assembla.com upstream. Thanks!</p>
